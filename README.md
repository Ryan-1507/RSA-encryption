# RSA-encryption

A python tool that encrypts any text file using the SHA-256 hash algorithm, it also gives the users the ability to decrypt their files afterwards.

Users just need to add the path of their text file into the terminal (no quotation marks) and then the new encrypted file will be saved in the same directory.
